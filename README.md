## Special Thanks üéÅ

Thanks to [Jan Raasch](janraasch.com), for putting in the hard work which I've lifted completely. Also, I second Jan's thanks to [Herman](https://herman.bearblog.dev), for creating the original [ ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). Cheers, guys - I apologies if some of my design decisions with this theme are cringeworthy, but wanted to make something that fits the specific needs of my site!
